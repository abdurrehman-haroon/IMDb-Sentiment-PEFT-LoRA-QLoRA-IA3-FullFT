## 1. Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [HuggingFace - ccdv/arxiv-summarization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ccdv/arxiv-summarization)
- **Subset Used:** 5,000 samples (each containing `article` and `abstract`)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Articles were used as input, abstracts as targets.
  - Tokenized with `google/flan-t5-base` tokenizer.
  - Split into 80% train, 10% validation, 10% test sets.
  - Token length limited to 1024 (input), 256 (target).

---

## 2. Model and LoRA Configuration

- **Base Model Used:** `google/flan-t5-base` (for compatibility and quick training)
- **LoRA (PEFT) Configuration:**
  - `r = 8`
  - `alpha = 16`
  - `dropout = 0.1`
  - Applied to: attention layers `q` and `v`
- **Training Setup:**
  - 4 epochs
  - 8-bit loading with `bitsandbytes`
  - Batch size = 2
  - Mixed precision (fp16)
- **Libraries:** `transformers`, `peft`, `datasets`, `accelerate`

## 3. Training Logs & Observations

- **Loss Curve:** Loss decreased consistently over epochs.
- **GPU:** Runtime on Colab with T4 GPU and ~16GB RAM.
- **Training Time:** ~25 minutes for 4 epochs on 5k samples.

## 6. Multi-Agent System (LangGraph)

### üîó Architecture
- **KeywordAgent:** Expands user queries to better search terms.
- **SearchAgent:** Searches dummy paper set (extensible to arXiv API).
- **RankAgent:** Ranks by citations.
- **SummaryAgent:** Summarizes using our LoRA model.
- **CompareAgent:** Extracts shared insights, contradictions, and research gaps.

### üß™ Output
- Top 3 papers selected.
- Summaries generated.
- Comparative analysis created.

LangGraph DAG structure and agents are implemented in the notebook.
